Project: US Presidents Data Cleaning

Understanding the Dataset:
The dataset contains information about US Presidents, including their names, prior roles, party affiliations, and salaries.


Steps Performed:

1.Data Cleaning:
Corrected inconsistent text formats in the president column (e.g., unified case, fixed typos like "john adams" to "John Adams").
Standardized party names by removing extra spaces or special characters (e.g., Democratic- Republican to Democratic-Republican).

2.Date Formatting:
Reformatted date updated and date created columns to ensure consistency in date formats (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).

3.Data Validation:
Checked for duplicate entries or erroneous data in columns like salary and vice.

4.Additional Insights:
Added calculated fields such as Tenure (using date created and historical data).

5.Visualization:
Created summary charts for average salaries by party and tenure analysis.

6.Outcome:
Cleaned and validated dataset ready for further analysis or presentation, ensuring consistency and usability for historical or political studies.
